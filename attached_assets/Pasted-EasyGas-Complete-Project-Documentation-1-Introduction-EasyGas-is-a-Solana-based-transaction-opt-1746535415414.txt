EasyGas – Complete Project Documentation

1. Introduction

EasyGas is a Solana-based transaction optimizer designed to help users track network congestion, predict transaction speeds, and optimize transactions by recommending priority fees when necessary.

Unlike traditional blockchain tools, EasyGas does not focus on gas fee savings (as Solana has low fixed fees) but instead helps users avoid transaction delays by providing real-time congestion insights, priority fee recommendations, and historical analytics.


2. Project Goals & Objectives

✅ Primary Goal:

To help Solana users reduce transaction delays by providing real-time congestion tracking and optimization tools.

✅ Key Objectives:

Monitor Solana network congestion in real-time.

Provide priority fee recommendations for faster transaction processing.

Offer historical data and analytics for better transaction timing.

Enable seamless wallet integration for a smooth user experience.

Send alerts and notifications when the network is congested.




3. Target Audience

EasyGas is designed for:

Solana traders who need fast transaction execution.

NFT collectors & minters who want to avoid failed transactions.

DeFi users who require smooth interactions with smart contracts.

DApp developers looking to integrate congestion analytics.




4. Features Overview

✅ Real-Time Network Congestion Tracking

Displays current Solana network load and block processing speed.

Helps users decide whether to wait or proceed with transactions.


✅ Priority Fee Optimization

Suggests optimal priority fees based on real-time congestion.

Allows users to customize transaction speed preferences.


✅ Historical Data & Analytics

Tracks past network congestion trends to help users plan transactions.

Provides insights on peak congestion periods.


✅ Alerts & Notifications

Sends real-time alerts for high congestion periods.

Notifies users of optimal transaction windows.


✅ Wallet & DApp Integration

Supports Phantom, Solflare, and other Solana wallets.

Allows DApp developers to integrate congestion tracking via API.



5. System Architecture

A. Frontend (User Interface)


Key Features:

Dashboard displaying live congestion and fee recommendations.

Graphical analytics of past congestion trends.

Transaction speed estimator to help users choose the best times to transact.



B. Backend (Data Processing & API)


API Endpoints:

1. /network-status – Fetches the current congestion level.


2. /historical-data – Provides past congestion patterns.


3. /priority-fee-recommendation – Suggests an optimal priority fee for faster transactions.



Data Collection:

Connects to Solana RPC nodes (QuickNode, GenesysGo, or Solana Labs RPC).

Fetches transaction processing times & block congestion rates.




C. Smart Contract (Solana Progmme)


Functions:

Priority Fee Tracker: Logs historical priority fees for faster transactions.

On-Chain Congestion Alerts: Uses smart contracts to notify users when the network is busy.


Deployment:

6. User Journey

1. User visits EasyGas → Connects wallet via Phantom/Solflare.


2. EasyGas retrieves congestion data from the Solana network.


3. User sees congestion status & priority fee recommendations.


4. User decides to submit a transaction with/without a priority fee.


5. Transaction executes smoothly with optimized settings.
